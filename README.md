# UFOs

## Overview of Project
In this project, a webpage will be created with UFO sightings data stored in a Javascript array with a fully dynamic table where users would be able to interact and filter out desired outputs.  Additionally, the webpage is further customized using Bootstrap.

## Results
The first feature users would see if the introduction panel.

Directly underneath the introduction panel will be the interactive table and filter bar.

Users will be able to filter the data with any number of filter options provided.

Here is an example of filtering the data with two factors.

## Summary
### Drawback
One major drawback to the webpage is the lack of drop down boxes for users to view filter options.  For example, users would not know how many different shapes there are available to view. 

### Recommendations for further development
1. Include drop down boxes for users' convenience.
2. To further increase users' interactivity with the webpage, there could be a submission panel for users' to submit their personal UFO sightings.  This could easily overwhelm the data with untrustworthy or messy data so in order to avoid this issue, the submission would require review by the webpage admins before the data get published.
